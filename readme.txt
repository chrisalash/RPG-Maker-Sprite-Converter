Before running the program:
Make sure you have the latest version of python installed
Easy way to do so is to download python latest (i recommend from the windows store) and run these 2 commands in the terminal/command prompt
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade Pillow

Steps to run the script:
-------------------------
1.) Make sure you have the template you want to edit in correct place. By default the program the program will target the blank template. You can either change it by including another file where the old one is with the same name or edit the file name in the python script. (For non programmers who want a nice editor I like VS code with python extension :D)

2.) Place all of the sprites you want to add into the pre_photos. The program will iterate through each of the photos and save after each sprite is placed in it's respective column. So you can either go one at a time if you want more control or if you wanna speed demon through it throw all of them in the folder.

3.) Open up a terminal/command prompt and cd into the folder where the python script is with the following command "cd FILEPATH" (you can obtain the filepath by copying the top line of file explorer) (also don't keep the quotes)

4.) run the command "python automate.py"

5.) Should run as usual! Happy automating!
